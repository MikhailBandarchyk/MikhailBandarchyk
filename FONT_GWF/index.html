<h1><center>Monkey business</center></h1>
<p>Well, outside my window there's a whole lotta trouble comin'<br>
    The cartoon killers and the rag cover clones<br>
    Stack heels kickin' rhythm of social circumcision<br>
    Can't close the closet on a shoe box full of bones</p>
    
   <p> Kangaroo lady with her bourbon in a pouch<br>
    Can't afford the rental on a bamboo couch<br>
    Collecting back her favors cause her well is running dry<br>
    I know her act is terminal, but she ain't gonna die, no</p>
    
<p> Slim Intoxicado drinkin' dime store hooch<br>
    Is always in a circle with his part-time pooch<br>
    Little creepy's playing dollies<br>
    In the New York rain<br>
    Thinkin' Bowie's just a knife<br>
    Whoa, the pain!<br>
    I ain't seen the sun since I don't know when<br>
    The freaks come out at nine<br>
    And it's twenty to ten<br>
    What's this funk that you call junk?<br>
    To me it's just monkey business<br>
    Get back!</p>
    
<p> Blind man in a box and he'll probably die<br>
    The village kids laugh as they walk by<br>
    A psycho on the edge of this human garbage dump<br>
    And the vultures in the sewers are telling him to jump<br>
    Into the fire, from the frying pan<br>
    Tripping on his tongue for a cool place to stand<br>
    Where's this shade<br>
    That you've got it made?<br>
    To me it's just monkey business</p>
    
<p> (Monkey business) Slippin' on the track<br>
    (Monkey business) Jungle in black<br>
    (Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back<br>
    (Monkey business) Slippin' on the track<br>
    (Monkey business) Jungle in black<br>
    (Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back</p>
    
   <p> The vaseline gypsies and silicone souls<br>
    Dressed to the society<br>
    Hypocrite heartbeat and cheap alibis<br>
    Can't get you by that monkey</p>
    
    <p>(Monkey business) Slippin' on the track<br>
    (Monkey business) Jungle in black<br>
    (Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back<br>
    (Monkey business) Slippin' on the track<br>
    (Monkey business) Jungle in black<br>
    (Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back<br>
    (Monkey business) You can't tell me, I got no business<br>
    (Ain't your business) No monkey on my back<br>
    Yeah, yay, cool<br>
    Monkey business, ness, business<br>
    Don't give me no business, no</p>
